## ea-competition

This website is intended to provide an accessible competition medium for students participating in Academic Decathlon.

Competition occurs in matches. In a match, a pair of students take the same quiz and the student that answers more questions correctly wins.

There are two ways to create a match. In Pool play, players wait in a pool of players and when another joins, the two compete in a match with a quiz covering a random topic and a set number of questions. In Challenge mode, one player sends a challenge to any other player that is registered, choosing a subject, number of questions, and a timing option. The other player can accept or reject the challenge. If the challenge is accepted, both players can take the quiz.

All matches are stored, and players can use the History feature of the website to review past matches.
